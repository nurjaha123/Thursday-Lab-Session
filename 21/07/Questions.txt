1.Paul has bought a new notebook of "idol" brand, with a processor speed of 2.66GHz,
 8 GB of RAM, 500GB hard disk, with a 15-inch monitor, for $1760.55. He has chosen
 service plan 'C' among plans 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D', plus on-site servicing but did not 
choose extended warranty. Identify the data types and name the variables.

2.You are asked to develop a software for a college. The system shall maintain 
information about students. This includes name, address, phone number, gender, 
date of birth, height, weight, degree pursued (e.g., B.Sc., B.A.), year of
study,average GPA, with/without tuition grant, is/is not a scholar. Each 
student is assigned a unique 8-digit number as id.You are required to identify
the variables, assign a suitable name to each variable and choose an appropriate 
type. Write the variable declaration statements as in the above example.

3.When i is casted to c the value corresponding to the ascii code of 81 which is 'Q' is assigned.
When d is casted to i the decimal part .142 is truncated and only 323 is assigned to i.
Similarly when f is casted to i, the decimal part .38 is truncated and only 72 is assigned to i.
When d is casted to b whose range is -128 to 127, not only the decimal part .142 is truncated but
 it is also shortened from 323 to 67 so as to fit in byte range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "
i = 81 c = Q
d = 323.142 i = 323
f = 72.38 i = 72
d = 323.142 b = 67

4.Write a program that prompts the user to input an integer and then outputs the number
 with the digits reversed. For example, if the input is 12345, the output should be 54321.

5.Sum of Digits Program in Java

6.Java Program to Check Whether a Number is Positive or Negative

7.Prints the numbers from 1 to 100 such that:

If the number is a multiple of 3, you need to print "Deep" instead of that number.
If the number is a multiple of 5, you need to print "Tech" instead of that number.
If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, you need to print "DeepTech" instead of that number.
